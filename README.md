# Hi, I’m Samah 👋

Data Graduate Engineer | Machine Learning, Deep Learning & AI Innovator | Passionate about transforming healthcare with technology 🌟

I am on a journey to **build advanced theoretical and mathematical mastery in ML & DL**, bridging the worlds of data science and healthcare.  
Check my **Notes repositories** for curated summaries, key insights, and distilled knowledge from foundational ML, AI, and Digital Health resources.  

Alongside AI, I am deepening my **biology and medical knowledge** to connect the two fields and drive real-world healthcare transformation.  

Explore my **ML projects and research repositories** where I apply my learnings, experiment with new ideas, and advance my expertise in solving real-world problems.  

Next on the horizon: **enrolling in a Master’s in Digital Health** and pursuing a **PhD focused on applying Machine Learning for medical diagnosis, treatments, and healthcare innovation**.  

I believe that **knowledge, curiosity, and innovation** are the bridges to a smarter, healthier future,  and I’m building that bridge one insight, one project, and one experiment at a time.
