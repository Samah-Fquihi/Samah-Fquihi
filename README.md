# Hi, Iâ€™m Samah ðŸ‘‹

Data Engineer | Machine Learning, Deep Learning & AI Innovator | Passionate about transforming healthcare with technology ðŸŒŸ

I am on a journey to **build advanced Theoretical and mathematical mastery in ML & DL**, bridging the worlds of data science and healthcare.  
Check my [**Machine Learning Notes**](https://github.com/Samah-Fquihi/Machine-Learning-Notes) and my [**DeepLearning Notes**](https://github.com/Samah-Fquihi/DeepLearning-Notes) for curated summaries, key insights, and distilled knowledge from foundational ML, DL & AI Books and Digital Health resources.  

Alongside AI, I am deepening my **biology and medical knowledge** to connect the two fields and drive real-world healthcare transformation.  

Explore my [**ML Projects and Research Applied in Health & Medical Sector**](https://github.com/Samah-Fquihi/ML-Projects-Research-Applied-in-Health-and-Medical-Sector) where I apply my learnings, experiment with new ideas, and advance my expertise in solving real-world problems.  

Next on the horizon: **Enrolling in a Masterâ€™s in Digital Health âœ¨** and pursuing a **PhD focused on applying Machine Learning for medical diagnosis, treatments, and healthcare innovation**.  

I believe that **Knowledge, Curiosity, and Innovation** are the bridges to a smarter, healthier future,  and Iâ€™m building that bridge one insight, one project, and one experiment at a time.
